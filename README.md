# Design Doc Project

This project was a part of Lambda School's [User Interface Build Week](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/User-Interface-Project-Week)  

The rules were to make the website look as close to the design documents as possible using HTML, CSS (along with the LESS extension),  
and stretch goals of adding JavaScript functionality if we had extra time
