# Design Doc Project

This project was a part of Lambda School's [User Interface Build Week](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/User-Interface-Project-Week)  

The rules were to make the website look as close to the design documents as possible, with stretch goals of adding JavaScript functionality if we had extra time
